    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Spaghetti:</b> This recipe, which makes about four servings, starts with one pound of uncooked spaghetti. </li>
        <li><b>Oil:</b> You’ll need ½ cup of olive oil. </li>
        <li><b>Garlic:</b> Six cloves of thinly sliced garlic lends bold flavor. </li>
        <li><b>Seasonings:</b> This traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is flavored with crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley. </li>
        <li><b>Cheese:</b> For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead of opting for the pre-shredded stuff.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
